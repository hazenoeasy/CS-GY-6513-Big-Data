@@4000241 I think it is safe to say that ours is the only dining room in West Los Angeles on whose table -- an eight-foot-long , two-hundred-pound behemoth on which I have taken my meals for many years -- rest piles of photocopies of articles on suicide , all of which were printed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica over the past 220 years . They represent the convergence of two crucially important strands in my own life . Indeed , as I look at the articles , arrayed before me in fanlike tiers , I get the odd feeling that the old oak ruble on which I have eaten so many thousands of dinners has been set not with its customary china and silver but with my intellectual autobiography .
 <p> My special relationship with the Britannica is of long standing . It is relevant to report that I was a sickly child and stayed home from school a great deal . The reader can readily imagine the sort of boy I was : frail , bookish , and undersized ( I was small to begin with , and continued to shrink , comparatively speaking , as I was double-promoted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Our house , fifteen miles and seventy years from the one in which my wife and I live today , resembled those of many Eastern European Jewish immigrant families with intellectual aspirations . There were copies of Shakespeare , Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Conrad , and Mann , diligently assembled from the local Lincoln Heights Library 's list of " The 100 Best . " There was a windup Victrola and records of operatic arias sung by Caruso and Farrar . And in the center of all this -- the jewel in the Shneidman family 's cultural crown-there was the Ninth Edition of the Britannica , enshrined in a Stickley bookcase with glass doors and its own little key . The suite of Craftsman furniture to which the bookcase belonged also included a sofa , a chair , and a table . All of them are in my home today . <p> Among the happiest hours of my childhood were those spent alone at home , circa 1925 . My parents would be working in their clothing store , my brother and sister would be in school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tucked in their 1910 Grand Rapids mahogany bed between two billowy white sheets , listening to Farrar sing Gilda and reading the encyclopedia . I have little doubt that more than half of what I know today I learned from the pages of the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . I suspect that this accounts for my essentially nineteenth-century ideas about science . And I muse that my frenetic and nervous way of studying ( or reading or writing ) -- a lifelong habit -- could well be a happy remnant of the fact that my first earnest perusals of " The Geometry " or " Kant " were interrupted every few minutes by the need to leap out of my parents ' bed either to change the 78-rpm record or to wind the Victrola . It seems unlikely that I would so deeply love the intellectual life today had I not initially found my young mind 's independence within such a cozy and easeful setting . <p> Fast-forward to 1949 , the year that , quite by accident , I met my life 's second great strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Brentwood Veterans Administration hospital . On that particular morning I was in the subbasement of the old Los Angeles Hall of Records , in the coroner 's vault , looking at file folders containing the records of certified deaths . The director of my hospital had asked me to prepare letters to two young widows whose husbands had recently committed suicide while they were hospital patients . My intention was to look at the two men 's folders , make some notes , and get back to work . <p> The first folder contained something I had not seen before : a genuine suicide note . The second folder did not . Who could stop at this point ? I looked at several dozen folders . It seemed that every so often I would open a folder -- about one out of every fifteen suicide folders-and find a suicide note .
